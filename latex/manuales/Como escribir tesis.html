<H2>Introduction </H2>

<P>This note describes how to organize the written thesis which is the
central element of your graduate degree. To know how to organize the thesis
document, you first have to understand what graduate-level research is
all about, so that is covered too. In other words, this note should be
helpful when you are just getting started in your graduate program, as
well as later when you start to write your thesis. </P>

<H2>What Graduate Research is All About</H2>

<P>The distinguishing mark of graduate research is <I>an original contribution
to knowledge</I>. The thesis is a formal document whose sole purpose is
to prove that you have made an original contribution to knowledge. Failure
to prove that you have made such a contribution generally leads to failure.
</P>

<P>To this end, your thesis must show two important things: </P>

<UL>
<LI>you have identified a worthwhile problem or question which has not
been previously answered,</LI>

<LI>you have solved the problem or answered the question. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Your contribution to knowledge generally lies in your solution or answer.
</P>

<H2>What the Graduate Thesis is All About</H2>

<P>Because the purpose of the graduate thesis is to prove that you have
made an original and useful contribution to knowledge, the examiners read
your thesis to find the answers to the following questions: </P>

<UL>
<LI>what is this student's research question? </LI>

<LI>is it a good question? (has it been answered before? is it a useful
question to work on?) </LI>

<LI>did the student convince me that the question was adequately answered?
</LI>

<LI>has the student made an adequate contribution to knowledge? </LI>
</UL>

<P>A very <I>clear</I> statement of the question is essential to proving
that you have made an original and worthwhile contribution to knowledge.
To prove the originality and value of your contribution, you must present
a <I>thorough</I> review of the existing literature on the subject, and
on closely related subjects. Then, by making <I>direct</I> reference to
your literature review, you must <I>demonstrate</I> that your question
(a) has not been previously answered, and (b) is worth answering. Describing
how you answered the question is usually easier to write about, since you
have been intimately involved in the details over the course of your graduate
work. </P>

<P>If your thesis does not provide adequate answers to the few questions
listed above, you will likely be faced with a requirement for major revisions
or you may fail your thesis defence outright. For this reason, the generic
thesis skeleton given below is designed to highlight the answers to those
questions with appropriate thesis organization and section titles. The
generic thesis skeleton can be used for any thesis. While some professors
may prefer a different organization, the essential elements in any thesis
will be the same. Some further notes follow the skeleton. </P>

<P>Always remember that a thesis is a <I>formal</I> document: every item
must be in the appropriate place, and repetition of material in different
places should be eliminated. </P>

<H2>A Generic Thesis Skeleton </H2>

<P><B>1. Introduction</B> </P>

<P>This is a <I>general</I> introduction to what the thesis is all about
-- it is <I>not</I> just a description of the contents of each section.
Briefly <I>summarize</I> the question (you will be stating the question
in detail later), some of the reasons why it is a worthwhile question,
and perhaps give an overview of your main results. This is a birds-eye
view of the answers to the main questions answered in the thesis (see above).
</P>

<P><B>2. Background Information (optional)</B> </P>

<P>A brief section giving background information may be necessary, especially
if your work spans two or more traditional fields. That means that your
readers may not have any experience with some of the material needed to
follow your thesis, so you need to give it to them. A different title than
that given above is usually better; e.g., &quot;A Brief Review of Frammis
Algebra.&quot; </P>

<P><B>3. Review of the State of the Art</B> </P>

<P>Here you review the state of the art relevant to your thesis. Again,
a different title is probably appropriate; e.g., &quot;State of the Art
in Zylon Algorithms.&quot; The idea is to <I>present</I> (critical analysis
comes a little bit later) the major ideas in the state of the art right
up to, but not including, your own personal brilliant ideas. </P>

<P>You organize this section <I>by idea</I>, and not by author or by publication.
For example if there have been three important main approaches to Zylon
Algorithms to date, you might organize subsections around these three approaches,
if necessary: </P>

<UL>
<P>3.1 Iterative Approximation of Zylons <BR>
3.2 Statistical Weighting of Zylons <BR>
3.3 Graph-Theoretic Approaches to Zylon Manipulation </P>
</UL>

<P><B>4. Research Question or Problem Statement</B> </P>

<P>Engineering theses tend to refer to a &quot;problem&quot; to be solved
where other disciplines talk in terms of a &quot;question&quot; to be answered.
In either case, this section has three main parts: </P>

<UL>
<P>1. a concise statement of the question that your thesis tackles <BR>
2. justification, by <I>direct</I> reference to section 3, that your question
is previously unanswered<BR>
3. discussion of why it is worthwhile to answer this question. </P>
</UL>

<P>Item 2 above is where you <I>analyze</I> the information which you presented
in Section 3. For example, maybe your problem is to &quot;develop a Zylon
algorithm capable of handling very large scale problems in reasonable time&quot;
(you would further describe what you mean by &quot;large scale&quot; and
&quot;reasonable time&quot; in the problem statement). Now in your <I>analysis</I>
of the state of the art you would show how each class of current approaches
fails (i.e. can handle only small problems, or takes too much time). In
the last part of this section you would explain why having a large-scale
fast Zylon algorithm is useful; e.g., by describing applications where
it can be used. </P>

<P>Since this is one of the sections that the readers are <I>definitely</I>
looking for, highlight it by using the word &quot;problem&quot; or &quot;question&quot;
in the title: e.g. &quot;Research Question&quot; or &quot;Problem Statement&quot;,
or maybe something more specific such as &quot;The Large-Scale Zylon Algorithm
Problem.&quot; </P>

<P><B>5. Describing How You Solved the Problem or Answered the Question</B></P>

<P>This part of the thesis is much more free-form. It may have one or several
sections and subsections. But it all has only one purpose: to convince
the examiners that you answered the question or solved the problem that
you set for yourself in Section 4. So show what you did that is <I>relevant</I>
to answering the question or solving the problem: if there were blind alleys
and dead ends, do <I>not</I> include these, unless specifically relevant
to the demonstration that you answered the thesis question. </P>

<P><B>6. Conclusions</B> </P>

<P>You generally cover three things in the Conclusions section, and each
of these usually merits a separate subsection: </P>

<UL>
<P>1. Conclusions <BR>
2. Summary of Contributions <BR>
3. Future Research </P>
</UL>

<P>Conclusions are <I>not</I> a rambling summary of the thesis: they are
<I>short</I>, <I>concise</I> statements of the inferences that you have
made because of your work. It helps to organize these as short numbered
paragraphs, ordered from most to least important. All conclusions should
be directly related to the research question stated in Section 4. Examples:
</P>

<UL>
<P>1. The problem stated in Section 4 has been solved: as shown in Sections
? to ??, an algorithm capable of handling large-scale Zylon problems in
reasonable time has been developed. </P>

<P>2. The principal mechanism needed in the improved Zylon algorithm is
the Grooty mechanism. </P>

<P>3. Etc. </P>
</UL>

<P>The Summary of Contributions will be much sought and carefully read
by the examiners. Here you list the contributions of <I>new</I> knowledge
that your thesis makes. Of course, the thesis itself must substantiate
any claims made here. There is often some overlap with the Conclusions,
but that's okay. Concise numbered paragraphs are again best. Organize from
<I>most</I> to <I>least</I> important. Examples: </P>

<UL>
<P>1. Developed a much quicker algorithm for large-scale Zylon problems.
</P>

<P>2. Demonstrated the first use of the Grooty mechanism for Zylon calculations.
</P>

<P>3. Etc. </P>
</UL>

<P>The Future Research subsection is included so that researchers picking
up this work in future have the benefit of the ideas that you generated
while you were working on the project. Again, concise numbered paragraphs
are usually best. </P>

<P><B>7. References</B> </P>

<P>The list of references is closely tied to the review of the state of
the art given in section 3. Most examiners scan your list of references
looking for the important works in the field, so make sure they are listed
and referred to in section 3. Truth be known, most examiners also look
for their own publications if they are in the topic area of the thesis,
so list these too. Besides, reading your examiner's papers usually gives
you a clue as to the type of questions they are likely to ask. </P>

<P>All references given <I>must</I> be referred to in the main body of
the thesis. Note the difference from a Bibliography, which may include
works that are not directly referenced in the thesis. Organize the list
of references either alphabetically by author surname (preferred), or by
order of citation in the thesis. </P>

<P><B>8. Appendices</B> </P>

<P>What goes in the appendices? Any material which impedes the smooth development
of your presentation, but which is important to justify the results of
a thesis. Generally it is material that is of too nitty-gritty a level
of detail for inclusion in the main body of the thesis, but which should
be available for perusal by the examiners to convince them sufficiently.
Examples include program listings, immense tables of data, lengthy mathematical
proofs or derivations, etc. </P>

<H2>Comments on the Skeleton </H2>

<P>Again, the thesis is a formal document designed to address the examiner's
two main questions. Sections 3 and 4 show that you have chosen a good problem,
and section 5 shows that you solved it. Sections 1 and 2 lead the reader
into the problem, and section 6 highlights the main knowledge generated
by the whole exercise. </P>

<P>Note also that everything that <I>others</I> did is carefully separated
from everything that <I>you</I> did. Knowing who did what is important
to the examiners. Section 4, the problem statement, is the obvious dividing
line. That's the main reason for putting it in the middle in this formal
document. </P>

<H2>Getting Started </H2>

<P>The best way to get started on your thesis is to prepare an extended
outline. You begin by making up the Table of Contents, listing each section
and subsection that you propose to include. For each section and subsection,
write a brief point-form description of the contents of that section. The
entire outline might be 2 to 5 pages long. Now you and your thesis supervisor
should carefully review this outline: is there unnecessary material (i.e.
not directly related to the problem statement)? Then remove. Is there missing
material? Then add. It is much less painful and more time-efficient to
make such decisions early, during the outline phase, rather than after
you've already done a lot of writing which has to be thrown away. </P>

<H2>How Long Does it Take to Write a Thesis? </H2>

<P>Longer than you think. Even after the research itself is all done --
models built, calculations complete -- it is wise to allow at least one
complete term for writing the thesis. It's not the physical act of typing
that takes so long, it's the fact that writing the thesis requires the
complete organization of your arguments and results. It's during this formalization
of your results into a well-organized thesis document capable of withstanding
the scrutiny of expert examiners that you discover weaknesses. It's fixing
those weaknesses that takes time. </P>

<P>This is also probably the first time that your supervisor has seen the
formal expression of concepts that may have been approved previously in
an informal manner. Now is when you discover any misunderstandings or shortcomings
in the informal agreements. It takes time to fix these. Students for whom
english is not the mother tongue may have difficulty in getting ideas across,
so that numerous revisions are required. And, truth be known, supervisors
are sometimes not quick at reviewing and returning drafts. </P>

<P>Bottom line: leave yourself enough time. A rush job has painful consequences
at the defence. </P>

<H2>Tips </H2>

<P><I>Always keep the reader's backgrounds in mind.</I> Who is your audience?
How much can you reasonably expect them to know about the subject before
picking up your thesis? Usually they are pretty knowledgeable about the
general problem, but they haven't been intimately involved with the details
over the last couple of years like you have: spell difficult new concepts
out clearly. It sometimes helps to mentally picture a real person that
you know who has the appropriate background, and to imagine that you are
explaining your ideas directly to that person. </P>

<P><I>Don't make the readers work too hard!</I> This is fundamentally important.
You know what few questions the examiners need answers for (see above).
Choose section titles and wordings to clearly give them this information.
The harder they have to work to ferret out your problem, your defence of
the problem, your answer to the problem, your conclusions and contributions,
the worse mood they will be in, and the more likely that your thesis will
need major revisions. </P>

<P>A corollary of the above: <I>it's impossible to be too clear</I>! Spell
things out carefully, highlight important parts by appropriate titles etc.
There's a huge amount of information in a thesis: make sure you direct
the readers to the answers to the important questions. </P>

<P>Remember that <I>a thesis is not a story</I>: it usually doesn't follow
the chronology of things that you tried. It's a formal document designed
to answer only a few major questions. </P>

<P>Avoid using phrases like &quot;Clearly, this is the case...&quot; or
&quot;Obviously, it follows that ...&quot;; these imply that, if the readers
don't understand, then they must be stupid. They might not have understood
because you explained it poorly. </P>

<P>Avoid <I>red flags</I>, claims (like &quot;software is the most important
part of a computer system&quot;) that are really only your personal opinion
and not substantiated by the literature or the solution you have presented.
Examiners like to pick on sentences like that and ask questions like, &quot;Can
you demonstrate that software is the most important part of a computer
system?&quot; </P>

<H2>A Note on Computer Programs and Other Prototypes </H2>

<P>The purpose of your thesis is to clearly document an original contribution
to <I>knowledge. </I>You may develop computer programs, prototypes, or
other tools as a means of proving your points, but remember, the thesis
is <I>not</I> about the tool, it is about the contribution to knowledge.
Tools such as computer programs are fine and useful products, but you can't
get an advanced degree just for the tool. You must use the tool to demonstrate
that you have made an original contribution to knowledge; e.g., through
its use, or ideas it embodies. </P>

<H2>Master's vs. PhD Thesis </H2>

<P>There are different expectations for Master's theses and for Doctoral
theses. This difference is not in format but in the significance and level
of discovery as evidenced by the problem to be solved and the summary of
contributions; a Doctoral thesis necessarily requires a more difficult
problem to be solved, and consequently more substantial contributions.
</P>

<P>The contribution to knowledge of a Master's thesis can be in the nature
of an incremental improvement in an area of knowledge, or the application
of known techniques in a new area. The Ph.D. must be a substantial and
innovative contribution to knowledge. </P>
